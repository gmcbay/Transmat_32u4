# Transmat_32u4
Transmat receiver for Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE

This code can be flashed on to an Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE using the Arudino IDE.  It will receive bluetooth UART data packets from another device (eg. an Android Tablet/Phone) and transmit the character data as keyboard key presses to allow for quick single button press in-game callouts using the text chat system in Destiny 2 on consoles.
